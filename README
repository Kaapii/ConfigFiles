    1. Emacs

* All the files in the directory ``emacs`` must be placed in your
  `$HOME` directory. You should have ::

       $HOME/.emacs
       $HOME/.emacs.conf
       $HOME/.myemacs

* The ``.emacs.conf`` directory contains all the Emacs-Lisp needed for
  this configuration

* The ``.emacs`` file contains the lines you should copy into your own
  configuration file (if you have one) so you don't loose it.

* The last file, ``.myemacs`` is the `real` configuration files.
  It is written in Emacs-Lisp.

* Feel free to have a look in ``.myemacs`` to add new lines.


    2. Shell

* All the files in the directory ``shell`` must be placed in your
  `$HOME` directory. You should have ::

       $HOME/.bashrc
       $HOME/.mybashrc

* These configurations file only works for a `bash` shell.

  configuration file (if you have one) so you don't loose it.
